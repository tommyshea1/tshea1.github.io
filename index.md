# Objective

Recent graduate currently pursuing a career in IT/Analytics. Began my professional journey with a small, women owned, general contracting company to acquire real world business experience and skills. Enjoy being a liaison between big data to insightful visual takeaways in laymen terms. Seeking to leverage my technical and business experience as a valuable team member in an analytics or IT role.

## Personal Projects

| Project Name |     Description         | Language  |
|:-------------|:------------------------|:----------|
| Asteroids    | Recreated Asteroids     | Python    |
| MazeSolver   | Maze Generator/Solver   | Python    |
| BookBot      | Statistical Book Report | Python    |
| Tableau Vis' | UFC, McDonalds, Winery  | R/Tableau |

### Project Takeaways:

- Asteroids:
  - Has spaceship movement, flying asteroids, shooting mechanics(projecticle will break apart asteroids)
  - Utilized Python's 'pygame' & 'venv'
    - Plan to implement a score system and power-ups (ex. A condition that will allow fire rate to exceed maximum)
- Maze Solver:
  - Randomly generates walls, the open paths, a starting point, and an endpoint
  - Deployed a pathfinding algorithm that will also visualy show the solution path
  - Potential implementations include: create a larger/complex maze to solve, having some sort of interactability within the maze game
- BookBot:
  - This bot will parse text, do searches on keywords or phrases, and provide a summary based on inputs
  - Plan to incorporate NLP techniques(pre-trained GPT models) for more complex summarizations and comprehension
- Tableau Vis':
  - R-Studio to clean and merge multiple data sets to create visualizations (ex. transactional data 2021-Q1 & 2021-Q2, merge and find cross-selling opportunitites)
